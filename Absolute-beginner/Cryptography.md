## What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the practice of using codes and ciphers to protect information and ensure that it can be transmitted securely between parties. 
The purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity to communication. 

Confidentiality means that only the intended recipient can read the message

Integrity means that the message has not been tampered with or altered in any way. 

Authenticity means that the message is from the expected sender and has not been forged

Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies use a variety of different cryptography concepts for security. Without cryptography, these systems would be vulnerable to attacks, fraud, and manipulation. 
Cryptography is a critical component of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies

Lets take a look at some of the most crucial concepts that are used:


### Hashing

Hashing is a process of creating a unique digital fingerprint, called a hash, by converting input data of any size or length into a fixed-size output using a mathematical algorithm

The output is a unique string of characters that is representative of the input data. 

Even a small change in the input data would produce a completely different hash output. You can try this here: sha3

Blockchain uses hashes to link the blocks together in the chain. Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a secure and tamper-proof link between them
