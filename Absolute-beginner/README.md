# Solidity Mastery: Absolute Beginner

Welcome to Solidity Mastery, a comprehensive learning project for mastering Solidity, the programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of this section is to help you develop a strong foundation and understand your starting point before you begin with Solidity

## Introduction to Programming
Before diving into Solidity, it is important to have a basic understanding of programming concepts. This section will cover some fundamental programming concepts to help you get started.

## Blockchain and How it Works
In this section, we will explore what blockchain technology is and how it works. We will also discuss some of the key features that make blockchain technology so innovative and powerful.

## What is Crypto and Web3?
In this section, we will introduce you to the world of cryptocurrency and how it relates to blockchain technology. We will also discuss what Web3 is and how it enables decentralized applications (dapps) to be built on the blockchain.

## What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. In this section, we will explore the history of Bitcoin, how it works, and some of its key features.

## What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and dapps. In this section, we will discuss what Ethereum is, how it differs from Bitcoin, and why it is so important.

## What are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are coded on the blockchain. In this section, we will discuss what smart contracts are, how they work, and some of their key features.

## What are dapps?
Decentralized applications (dapps) are applications that run on the blockchain. In this section, we will discuss what dapps are, how they work, and why they are important.

## What is Solidity?
Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this section, we will introduce you to Solidity, how it works, and some of its key features.

## Essentials
This section will cover the essential tools and resources you will need to get started with Solidity. It will also include a quiz to help you test your knowledge.
