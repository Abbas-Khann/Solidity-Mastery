## Consensus

First of all, consensus isnt mining.

Mining is a specific process within the larger process of achieving consensus. 

While mining creates new blocks, consensus ensures that all nodes in the network are in agreement about the validity of those blocks and their contents

Consensus refers to the agreement among network participants on the state of the blockchain.

It is the process by which nodes in the network come to a common understanding of the current state of the blockchain

Consensus is important because it ensures that all nodes in the network have the same view of the blockchain. Without consensus, the integrity and security of the blockchain would be compromised

There are several consensus methods used in blockchain technology. Here are some of the most common ones:

### Methods

Proof-of-Work (PoW):

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the most popular consensus method used in the blockchain technology powering Bitcoin. In this algorithm, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. 

The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the block to his copy and is rewarded.

The process requires significant computational power and electricity, making it energy-intensive and slow.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS):

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is another consensus method that requires participants to have a certain stake in the network. 

In PoW, miners compete to find the valid hash and mine the block but in PoS, validators(miners) are chosen to find the valid hash and mine the block.

In this algorithm, validators are chosen to mine new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. 

PoS is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than PoW.
