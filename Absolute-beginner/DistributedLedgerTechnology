## Distributed ledger technology(DLT)

DLT is a type of a database that can be shared, replicated and synchronized among a large number of participants who are spread across different geographical areas. 

It is a protocol that enables the secure functioning of a blockchain. Data is entered and updated by participants involved in the network. 

All changes can be written and saved to all involved devices only after approval by the majority. It is a network of participants holding equal control.

The main characteristics of DLT is decentralization and security. There is no central authority that enters and updates the data. 

Each participant holds a copy of that database and shares it with other participants. These participants are called nodes.


### Analogy

A good analogy for DLT is a Google Doc.

When you share a Google Doc with a group of people, the document is simply distributed instead of copied or transferred. 

This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document
